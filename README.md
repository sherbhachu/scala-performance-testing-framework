# scala-performance-testing-framework
An example project on how to use Gatling, a performance testing library (Scala) to test web services

### Proposed intention of the framework....

## Assumptions...

 1. You have some level of exposure to Java/Scala/OO languages
 2. You have the necessary Scala tools installed (I will provide some basic setup instrictions and some useful links to help you get started)
 3. You have some level of understanding of APIs, web services and the HTTP protocol
 4. You know the difference between a GET/POST request and why a 200 is a good thing and a 404 is not.

## What this will be/ What will be included...
 1. A basic Gatling project which allows you to test both GET and POST endpoints.
 2. Implementation, to some point of the 'Page Object Model' to allow for separation of tests/implementation.
 3. Reading configs from files/local resources.
 4. Approptiate references/documentation links.
 5. An idea of how a framework can be setup to handle a real world app.

## What might be included...
 1. Some example of basic reporting use of config files.
 2. Some level of on-the-fly configuration
 
## What this is not...
 1. An all-in-one super duper framework.
 2. Something that you can 100% copy over for any app (though I suspect you'd be able to use most, as is).

## Known limitations...
